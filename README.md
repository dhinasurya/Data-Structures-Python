# Python Data Structures from Scratch

This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms, written from scratch for learning and quick revision. Each module is well-commented for clarity.

## Included Data Structures & Algorithms

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Full implementation with insert, delete, search, traversal, min/max, and balancing features.
- **Doubly Linked List (DLL)**
- **Singly Linked List (SLL)**
- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Heap**
- **Hash Table**
- **Graphs**: Adjacency list/matrix, BFS, DFS, shortest path, etc.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick sort, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Classic problems and patterns.
- **Recursion**: Examples and classic problems.

## Features

- All code is written from scratch (no prebuilt libraries).
- Clean, readable, and well-commented code for easy understanding.
- Suitable for interview prep, revision, and learning.
- Modular structure for each data structure/algorithm.
- Example usage and test cases included where relevant.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repo-url>
    ```
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3. Explore the code in each module/folder.
